Problem 4:
What is the square root of 16?

Baseline response:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the square root of 16. Hmm, let me think about this. I remember that a square root of a number is another number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. So, if I'm looking for the square root of 16, I need to find a number that times itself equals 16.

Let me start by recalling some basic square numbers. I know that 4 times 4 is 16 because 4 squared is 16. So, that makes me think that 4 is a square root of 16. But wait, I also remember that square roots can have both positive and negative values because a negative times a negative is a positive. So, -4 times -4 should also be 16. That means both 4 and -4 are square roots of 16.

I should also consider if there are any other square roots. I think about perfect squares around 16. 5 squared is 25, which is more than 16, and 3 squared is 9, which is less than 16. So, 4 is the only whole number that perfectly squares to 16. But since we're talking about square roots, both positive and negative are valid.

I wonder if there are any irrational square roots for 16. I know that numbers like 2, 3, 5, and 7 don't have whole number square roots, but 16 is a perfect square, so it's straightforward. Therefore, the square roots of 16 are 4 and -4.

I should also think about how to represent this mathematically. The square root symbol √ is used, so √16 would equal 4 and -4. Sometimes people just write the principal (positive) square root, which is 4, but technically, both are correct.

To double-check, I can square 4 and -4. 4 times 4 is

\]

Let's add 5 seven times:

\[
5 + 5 = 10 \\
10 + 5 = 15 \\
15 + 5 = 20 \\
20 + 5 = 25 \\
25 + 5 = 30

Intervention response:

Okay, so I need to figure out the square root of 16. Hmm, let me think about this. I remember that a square root of a number is another number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. So, if I'm looking for the square root of 16, I need to find a number that times itself equals 16.

Alright, let me start by recalling some basic square numbers. I know that 4 times 4 is 16 because 4 squared is 16. So, that makes me think that 4 is a square root of 16. But wait, I also remember that square roots can have both positive and negative values because a negative times a negative is a positive. So, -4 times -4 should also be 16. That means both 4 and -4 are square roots of 16.

I should also consider if there are any other square roots. Let me think, 5 squared is 25, which is more than 16, so that's too big. 3 squared is 9, which is less than 16. So, 3 isn't a square root of 16. What about fractions? If I take 16 and divide it by 4, I get 4, which we've already considered. If I take 16 and divide it by 9, that's about 1.777..., which isn't a whole number. So, I don't think fractions are the answer here.

Wait, but sometimes people talk about the principal square root, which is the positive one. So, in that case, the principal square root of 16 would just be 4. But the question didn't specify whether it wants all square roots or just the principal one. I should probably mention both 4 and -4 to be thorough.

Let me double-check by squaring 4 and -4. 4 times 4 is 16, and (-4

Problem 5:
What is 10 divided by 2?

Intervention response:

Okay, so I need to figure out what 10 divided by 2 is. Hmm, let's see. I remember that division is splitting a number into equal parts. So, if I have 10 and I divide it by 2, I'm basically splitting 10 into two equal groups. 

Let me think about it step by step. If I have 10 apples and I split them equally between two friends, each friend would get 5 apples. So, 10 divided by 2 is 5. That makes sense because 2 times 5 equals 10. 

Wait, maybe I should double-check. If I multiply 2 by 5, I get 10, which matches the original number. So, that confirms it. Yeah, 10 divided by 2 is definitely 5.
</think>

10 divided by 2 equals 5. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Problem:** We need to divide 10 by 2.
2. **Divide the Numbers:** 10 ÷ 2 = 5.
3. **Verification:** Multiply the result by 2 to ensure it equals the original number (2 × 5 = 10).

**Answer:** 10 ÷ 2 = 5.

Let me start by recalling some basic square numbers. I know that 4 times 4 is 16 because 4 squared is 16. So, that makes me think that 4 is a square root of 16. But wait, I also remember that square roots can have both positive and negative values because a negative times a negative is a positive. So, -4 times -4 should also be 16. That means both 4 and -4 are square roots of 16.

I should also consider if there are any other square roots. I think about perfect squares around 16. 5 squared is 25, which is more than 16, and 3 squared is 9, which is less than 16. So, 4 is the integer square root. But since we're talking about square roots in general, not just integers, I should consider both the positive and negative roots.

I wonder if there are any irrational square roots for 16. Well, 16 is a perfect square, so its square root is an integer, not an irrational number. That means the square root of 16 is exactly 4 and -4. I don't think there are any other square roots because 16 doesn't have any other factors besides 1 and itself that would result in a whole number when squared.

Wait, let me double-check that. If I take 4 times 4, that's 16. And (-4) times (-4) is also 16. So, both of those are correct. I don't think there are any other numbers that when

But wait, I also remember that square roots can have both positive and negative values because a negative times a negative is a positive. So, does that mean both 4 and -4 are square roots of 16?

I think so. So, √16 is 4, and -√16 is -4. But sometimes people just mention the principal square root, which is the positive one. So, in many cases, especially in math problems, they might just want the positive answer, which is 4.

Let me double-check that. If I square 4, I get 16, and if I square -4, I also get 16. So both are correct. But depending on the context, sometimes only the positive one is considered. I should probably mention both to be thorough.

Wait, is there a more formal way to write this? I think it's written as ±4, which means both the positive and negative values. So, √16 = ±4. Yeah, that makes sense because both 4 and -4 squared give 16.

I don't think I'm missing anything here. It's a pretty straightforward problem. I don't need to consider other numbers because 4 is the simplest and most direct answer. No fractions or decimals involved here since 16 is a perfect square. If it wasn't a perfect square, the square root would be an irrational number,

I remember from school that when you add two numbers, you're combining their quantities. So, if I have two apples and someone gives me two more apples, how many do I have in total?

Wait, maybe I should visualize it. If I have two groups of two, that's like having two pairs. So, two plus two would make four. Yeah, that makes sense. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes in math, things can be tricky. Maybe I should try using my fingers to count. Two on one hand and two on the other, that's four fingers in total. Okay, that checks out.

I also remember something about the number line. Starting at zero and moving two steps to the right, then another two steps. That would land me at four. So, that's another way to confirm it. Or maybe I can use objects. If I have two books and someone gives me two more, how many books do I have? Four. Yeah, that seems right.

I wonder if there's a mathematical operation or formula for this. Addition is just combining quantities, right? So, 2 + 2 is like adding two quantities together.

What is the square root of 16?

Intervention response:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the square root of 16. Hmm, let me think about this. I remember that a square root of a number is another number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. So, if I'm looking for the square root of 16, I need to find a number that times itself equals 16.

Let me start by recalling some basic square numbers. I know that 4 times 4 is 16 because 4 squared is 16. So, that means 4 is a square root of 16. But wait, I also remember that square roots can have both positive and negative values because a negative times a negative is a positive. So, -4 times -4 is also 16. That means both 4 and -4 are square roots of 16.

I should also consider if there are any other square roots. I think about perfect squares around 16. 5 squared is 25, which is bigger than 16, and 3 squared is 9, which is smaller. So, 4 is the only whole number that perfectly squares to 16. But in math, especially in algebra, we often consider both the positive and negative roots unless specified otherwise.

I wonder if there are any irrational numbers that are square roots of 16. Well, 16 is a perfect square, so its square root is a whole number, not an irrational number. That makes sense because 16 doesn't have any fractional or decimal parts when you take its square root.

Let me double-check by actually calculating it. If I take 4 and multiply it by itself, 4 × 4 equals 16. Yep, that works. And if I take -4 and multiply it by itself, (-4) × (-4) is also 16. So both 4 and -4 are correct. 

I also remember that the square root symbol (√) can be used with

What is the square root of 16?

Intervention response:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the square root of 16. Hmm, let me think about this. I remember that a square root of a number is another number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. So, if I'm looking for the square root of 16, I need to find a number that times itself equals 16.

Let me start by recalling some basic square numbers. I know that 4 times 4 is 16 because 4 squared is 16. So, that means 4 is a square root of 16. But wait, I also remember that square roots can have both positive and negative values because a negative times a negative is a positive. So, -4 times -4 is also 16. That means both 4 and -4 are square roots of 16.

I should also consider if there are any other square roots. Well, 16 is a perfect square, so it has two square roots: the positive and the negative. I don't think there are any other numbers that when squared give 16. Let me double-check by squaring some numbers. 5 squared is 25, which is too big, and 3 squared is 9, which is too small. So, yeah, only 4 and -4 fit the bill.

I wonder if there's a way to represent this in a more mathematical way. The square root symbol is usually written with a plus-minus sign in front, like √16 = ±4. That makes sense because both the positive and negative numbers work. I think that's the correct way to denote both roots.

Maybe I should also think about the concept of square roots in a broader sense. For example, when we talk about the square root of a number, we're essentially looking for all numbers that can multiply together to give the original number. Since 4 times 4 is 16 and (-4) times (-4) is also

What is the square root of 16?

Intervention response:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the square root of 16. Hmm, let me think about this. I remember that a square root of a number is another number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. So, if I'm looking for the square root of 16, I need to find a number that times itself equals 16.

Let me start by recalling some basic square numbers. I know that 4 times 4 is 16 because 4 squared is 16. So, that means 4 is a square root of 16. But wait, I also remember that square roots can have both positive and negative values because a negative times a negative is a positive. So, -4 times -4 is also 16. That means both 4 and -4 are square roots of 16.

I should also consider if there are any other square roots. Well, 16 is a perfect square, so it has two square roots: one positive and one negative. I don't think there are any other numbers that when squared give 16. Let me double-check by squaring some numbers. 5 squared is 25, which is too big, and 3 squared is 9, which is too small. So, yeah, only 4 and -4 fit the bill.

I wonder if there's a formula or a method to find the square root of a number. I think it's something like taking the number and dividing it by 2 and then maybe doing some averaging or something. But in this case, since 16 is a perfect square, it's straightforward. I don't need to use a complicated method; I can just recognize it from memory.

Wait, maybe I should explain it more clearly. The square root of a number 'n' is a number 'x' such that x squared equals n. So, in this case, x² = 16. Solving for x, I can

Let me start by recalling some basic square numbers. I know that 4 times 4 is 16 because 4 squared is 16. So, that makes me think that the square root of 16 is 4. But wait, I also remember that square roots can have both positive and negative values because a negative times a negative is a positive. So, does that mean both 4 and -4 are square roots of 16?

I think so. For example, 4 multiplied by 4 is 16, and (-4) multiplied by (-4) is also 16. So, both 4 and -4 are correct square roots of 16. But usually, when people ask for the square root, they might just want the principal (positive) square root, which is 4. So, I should probably mention both, but maybe specify that the principal root is 4.

Let me double-check to make sure I'm not making a mistake. If I square 4, I get 16, and if I square -4, I also get 16. So, both are correct. But in many contexts, especially in math problems, they might just want the positive one unless specified otherwise. So, I should probably state that the square root of 16 is 4, and also note that -4 is also a square root.

I wonder if there are any other square roots of 16. Maybe fractions or decimals? Let me think. If I take 16 and divide it by 2, I get 8, but 8 squared is 64, which is too big.

I wonder if there are any irrational square roots for 16. I know that numbers like √2 or √3 don't have exact values, but 16 is a perfect square, so its square root is a whole number. Therefore, the square root of 16 is exactly 4, not a decimal or a fraction.

I should also think about how to represent this mathematically. The square root symbol √ is used to denote this. So, √16 equals 4. It's important to note that both 4 and -4 are correct because when you square either, you get 16. 

Maybe I can check this by squaring 4 and -4. 4 times 4 is 16, and (-4) times (-4)

But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Maybe I should visualize it. If I have two apples and someone gives me two more apples, how many do I have? That would be four apples. Yeah, that makes sense. Or if I have two books and another person has two books, together we have four books. So, yeah, 2 plus 2 should definitely be 4. I don't think it's anything else. It's a pretty straightforward addition problem. I don't recall any exceptions or special cases where 2 plus 2 wouldn't be 4. Maybe in some advanced math, but in basic arithmetic, it's just 4.

What is the square root of 16?

Intervention response:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the square root of 16. Hmm, let me think about this. I remember that a square root of a number is another number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. So, if I'm looking for the square root of 16, I need to find a number that times itself equals 16.

Let me start by recalling some basic square numbers. I know that 4 times 4 is 16 because 4 squared is 16. So, that makes me think that 4 is a square root of 16. But wait, I also remember that square roots can have both positive and negative values because a negative times a negative is a positive. So, -4 times -4 should also be 16. That means both 4 and -4 are square roots of 16.

I should also consider if there are any other square roots. I think about perfect squares around 16. 5 squared is 25, which is too big, and 3 squared is 9, which is too small. So, 4 and -4 are the only integers that fit. But I wonder if there are any other numbers that can be square roots of 16. Maybe fractions or decimals? Let me check.

If I take 16 and divide it by 2, I get 8, but 8 isn't a square number. If I divide it by 4, I get 4, which we already have. If I try dividing by 1, I get 16, but that's just 16 itself. So, it seems like 4 and -4 are the primary square roots. I don't think there are any other integers or simple fractions that work here.

I also remember something about the principal square root, which is the positive one. So, the principal square root of 16 is 4. But since the question just asks for the square root,

What is the square root of 16?

Intervention response:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the square root of 16. Hmm, let me think about this. I remember that a square root of a number is another number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. So, if I'm looking for the square root of 16, I need to find a number that times itself equals 16.

Let me start by recalling some basic square numbers. I know that 4 times 4 is 16 because 4 squared is 16. So, that makes me think that 4 is a square root of 16. But wait, I also remember that square roots can have both positive and negative values because a negative times a negative is a positive. So, -4 times -4 should also be 16. That means both 4 and -4 are square roots of 16.

I should also consider if there are any other square roots. I think about perfect squares around 16. 5 squared is 25, which is more than 16, and 3 squared is 9, which is less than 16. So, 4 is the only whole number that perfectly squares to 16. But since we're talking about square roots, both positive and negative are valid.

I wonder if there are any irrational square roots for 16. I know that numbers like 2, 3, 5, and 7 don't have whole number square roots, but 16 is a perfect square, so it's straightforward. Therefore, the square roots of 16 are 4 and -4.

I should also think about how to represent this mathematically. The square root symbol √ is used, so √16 would equal 4 and -4. Sometimes people just write the principal (positive) square root, which is 4, but technically, both are correct.

To double-check, I can square 4 and -4. 4 times 4 is

Problem 4:
What is the square root of 16?

Intervention response:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the square root of 16. Hmm, let me think about this. I remember that a square root of a number is another number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. So, if I have √16, I'm looking for a number that times itself equals 16.

Let me start by recalling some basic square numbers. I know that 4 times 4 is 16 because 4 squared is 16. So, that makes me think that the square root of 16 is 4. But wait, I also remember that square roots can have both positive and negative values because a negative times a negative is a positive. So, does that mean both 4 and -4 are square roots of 16?

I think so. For example, 4 multiplied by 4 is 16, and (-4) multiplied by (-4) is also 16. So, both 4 and -4 are correct square roots of 16. But usually, when people ask for the square root, they might just want the principal (positive) square root, which is 4. So, I should probably mention both, but maybe specify that the principal root is 4.

Let me double-check to make sure I'm not making a mistake. If I square 4, I get 16, and if I square -4, I also get 16. So, both are correct. But in many contexts, especially in math problems, they might just want the positive one. So, I should probably say that the square root of 16 is 4, but also note that -4 is also a square root.

I wonder if there are any other square roots of 16. Let me think. 16 is a perfect square, so it has two square roots: one positive and one negative. There aren't any other numbers that when squared give 16. For example, 5

Let me start by recalling some basic square numbers. I know that 4 times 4 is 16 because 4 squared is 16. So, that makes me think that 4 is a square root of 16. But wait, I also remember that square roots can have both positive and negative values because a negative times a negative is a positive. So, -4 times -4 is also 16. That means both 4 and -4 are square roots of 16.

I should also consider if there are any other square roots. I think about perfect squares around 16. 5 squared is 25, which is bigger than 16, and 3 squared is 9, which is smaller. So, 4 is the only whole number that perfectly squares to 16. But since we're talking about square roots, both positive and negative are valid.

I wonder if there are any irrational square roots for 16. I know that numbers like 2, 3, 5, and 7 don't have whole number square roots, but 16 is a perfect square, so it's straightforward. Therefore, the square roots of 16 are 4 and -4.

I should also think about how to represent this mathematically. The square root symbol √ is used, so √16 would equal both 4 and -4. Sometimes people just write the principal (positive) square root, which is 4, but technically, both are correct.

To double-check, I can square 4 and -4. 4 times 4 is 16, and

But wait, I also remember that square roots can have both positive and negative values because a negative times a negative is a positive. So, does that mean the square root of 16 is also -4?

I think so. So, √16 equals both 4 and -4 because both 4 squared and (-4) squared equal 16. But sometimes people just consider the principal square root, which is the positive one. So, depending on the context, the answer might be just 4. I should probably mention both to be thorough.

I should also consider if there are any other numbers that when squared give 16. Let me think: 5 squared is 25, which is too big, and 3 squared is 9, which is too small. So, 4 is the only number besides -4 that works. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the square root of 16 is 4 and -4. But if someone is asking for the principal square root, it's just 4.
</think>

The square root of 16 is both 4 and -4 because both 4² and (-4)² equal 16. However, the principal square root, which is the positive one, is typically considered the answer in many contexts.

So, 4 is the integer square root. But since we're talking about square roots in general, not just integers, I should consider both the positive and negative roots.

I wonder if there are any irrational square roots for 16. Well, 16 is a perfect square, so its square root is an integer, not an irrational number. That means the square root of 16 is exactly 4 and -4. I don't think there are any other square roots because 16 doesn't have any other factors besides 1 and itself that would result in a whole number when squared.

Wait, let me double-check that. If I take 4 times 4, I get 16. And (-4) times (-4) is also 16. So, both of those are correct. I don't think there are any other numbers that when

Problem 4:
What is the square root of 16?

Intervention response:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the square root of 16. Hmm, let me think about this. I remember that a square root of a number is another number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. So, if I'm looking for the square root of 16, I need to find a number that times itself equals 16.

Let me start by recalling some basic square numbers. I know that 4 times 4 is 16 because 4 squared is 16. So, that makes me think that 4 is a square root of 16. But wait, I also remember that square roots can have both positive and negative values because a negative times a negative is a positive. So, -4 times -4 should also be 16. That means both 4 and -4 are square roots of 16.

I should also consider if there are any other square roots. I think about perfect squares around 16. 5 squared is 25, which is more than 16, and 3 squared is 9, which is less than 16. So, 4 is the only whole number that perfectly squares to 16. But since we're talking about square roots, both positive and negative are valid.

I wonder if there are any irrational square roots for 16. I know that numbers like 2, 3, 5, and 7 don't have whole number square roots, but 16 is a perfect square, so it's straightforward. Therefore, the square roots of 16 are 4 and -4.

I should also think about how to represent this mathematically. The square root symbol √ is used, so √16 equals 4 and -4. Sometimes people just write the principal (positive) square root, which is 4, but technically, both are correct.

To double-check, I can square 4 and -4. 4 times 4 is 16

So, 4 is the integer square root. But since we're talking about square roots in general, not just integers, I should consider both the positive and negative roots.

I wonder if there are any irrational square roots for 16. Well, 16 is a perfect square, so its square root is an integer, not an irrational number. That means the square root of 16 is exactly 4 and -4. I don't think there are any other square roots because 16 doesn't have any other factors besides 1 and itself that multiply to give 16. So, 4 and -4 are the only real square roots.

So, yeah, 4 and -4 are the only ones.

I wonder if there's a way to express this in a more mathematical way. The square root symbol √ is used to denote both the positive and negative roots. So, √16 would be 4, and -√16 would be -4. But sometimes people just write √16 = ±4 to show both roots.

I also remember that 0 is a perfect square, but that's not relevant here. And numbers like 2 or 3 don't work because 2 squared is 4 and 3 squared is 9, which aren't 16. So, I'm pretty confident that the square root of 16 is

Let me start by recalling some basic square numbers. I know that 4 times 4 is 16 because 4 squared is 16. So, that makes me think that 4 is a square root of 16. But wait, I also remember that square roots can have both positive and negative values because a negative times a negative is a positive. So, -4 times -4 should also be 16. That means both 4 and -4 are square roots of 16.

I should also consider if there are any other square roots. I think about perfect squares around 16. 5 squared is 25, which is more than 16, and 3 squared is 9, which is less than 16. So, 4 is the only whole number that perfectly squares to 16. But since we're talking about square roots, both positive and negative are valid.

I wonder if there are any irrational square roots for 16. I know that numbers like 2, 3, 5, and 7 don't have whole number square roots, but 16 is a perfect square, so it's straightforward. Therefore, the square roots of 16 are 4 and -4.

I should also think about how to represent this mathematically. The square root symbol √ is used, so √16 would equal 4 and -4. Sometimes people just write the principal (positive) square root, which is 4, but technically, both are correct.

To double-check, I can square 4 and -4. 4 times 4 is

Problem 4:
What is the square root of 16?

Intervention response:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the square root of 16. Hmm, let me think about this. I remember that a square root of a number is another number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. So, if I'm looking for the square root of 16, I need to find a number that times itself equals 16.

Let me start by recalling some basic square numbers. I know that 4 times 4 is 16 because 4 squared is 16. So, that makes me think that 4 is a square root of 16. But wait, I also remember that square roots can have both positive and negative values because a negative times a negative is a positive. So, -4 times -4 should also be 16. That means both 4 and -4 are square roots of 16.

I should also consider if there are any other square roots. I think about perfect squares around 16. 5 squared is 25, which is more than 16, and 3 squared is 9, which is less than 16. So, 4 is the only whole number that perfectly squares to 16. But since we're talking about square roots, both positive and negative are valid.

I wonder if there are any irrational square roots for 16. I know that numbers like 2, 3, 5, and 7 don't have whole number square roots, but 16 is a perfect square, so it's straightforward. Therefore, the square roots of 16 are 4 and -4.

I should also think about how to represent this mathematically. The square root symbol √ is used, so √16 would equal 4 and -4. Sometimes people just write the principal (positive) square root, which is 4, but technically, both are correct.

To double-check, I can square 4 and -4. 4 times 4 is

Let me start by recalling some basic square numbers. I know that 4 times 4 is 16 because 4 squared is 16. So, that makes me think that 4 is a square root of 16. But wait, I also remember that square roots can have both positive and negative values because a negative times a negative is a positive. So, -4 times -4 should also be 16. That means both 4 and -4 are square roots of 16.

I should also consider if there are any other square roots. I think about perfect squares around 16. 5 squared is 25, which is more than 16, and 3 squared is 9, which is less than 16. So, 4 is the only whole number that perfectly squares to 16. But since we're talking about square roots, both positive and negative are valid.

I wonder if there are any irrational square roots for 16. I know that numbers like 2, 3, 5, and 7 don't have whole number square roots, but 16 is a perfect square, so it's straightforward. Therefore, the square roots of 16 are 4 and -4.

I should also think about how to represent this mathematically. The square root symbol √ is used, so √16 would equal 4 and -4. Sometimes people just write the principal (positive) square root, which is 4, but technically, both are correct.

To double-check, I can square 4 and -4. 4 times 4 is

What is the square root of 16?

Intervention response:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the square root of 16. Hmm, let me think about this. I remember that a square root of a number is another number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. So, if I'm looking for the square root of 16, I need to find a number that times itself equals 16.

Let me start by recalling some basic square numbers. I know that 4 times 4 is 16 because 4 squared is 16. So, that makes me think that 4 is a square root of 16. But wait, I also remember that square roots can have both positive and negative values because a negative times a negative is a positive. So, -4 times -4 should also be 16. That means both 4 and -4 are square roots of 16.

I should also consider if there are any other square roots. I think about perfect squares around 16. 5 squared is 25, which is more than 16, and 3 squared is 9, which is less than 16. So, 4 is the only whole number that perfectly squares to 16. But since we're talking about square roots, both positive and negative are valid.

I wonder if there are any irrational square roots for 16. I know that numbers like 2, 3, 5, and 7 don't have whole number square roots, but 16 is a perfect square, so it's straightforward. Therefore, the square roots of 16 are 4 and -4.

I should also think about how to represent this mathematically. The square root symbol √ is used, so √16 would equal 4 and -4. Sometimes people just write the principal (positive) square root, which is 4, but technically, both are correct.

To double-check, I can square 4 and -4. 4 times 4 is

So, 4 is the only whole number that perfectly squares to 16. But since we're talking about square roots, both positive and negative are valid.

I wonder if there are any irrational square roots for 16. I know that numbers like 2, 3, 5, and 7 don't have whole number square roots, but 16 is a perfect square, so it's straightforward. Therefore, the square roots of 16 are 4 and -4.

I should also think about how to represent this mathematically. The square root symbol √ is used, so √16 would equal 4 and -4. Sometimes people just write the principal (positive) square root, which is 4, but technically, both are correct.

To double-check, I can square 4 and -4. 4 times 4 is

What is the square root of 16?

Intervention response:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the square root of 16. Hmm, let me think about this. I remember that a square root of a number is another number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. So, if I'm looking for the square root of 16, I need to find a number that times itself equals 16.

Let me start by recalling some basic square numbers. I know that 4 times 4 is 16 because 4 squared is 16. So, that makes me think that 4 is a square root of 16. But wait, I also remember that square roots can have both positive and negative values because a negative times a negative is a positive. So, -4 times -4 should also be 16. That means both 4 and -4 are square roots of 16.

I should also consider if there are any other square roots. I think about perfect squares around 16. 5 squared is 25, which is more than 16, and 3 squared is 9, which is less than 16.
